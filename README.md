## 1. Introduction 🌟

This repository contains a collection of scripts to create initial folder and file structures for various types of applications. The scripts are organized into two main directories: one for Linux (`.shell` scripts) and one for Windows (`.bat` scripts). Each directory contains subdirectories for different types of projects.

## 4. Prerequisites 📋

Before using the scripts, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Linux
- Bash

### Windows
- Command Prompt or PowerShell

## 5. Usage ⚙️

### Linux

1. **Python AI Projects**
   - Navigate to the `Linux/python` directory:
     ```sh
     cd Linux/python
     ```
   - Copy the `setup-python-ai.sh` file to your project folder:
     ```sh
     cp setup-python-ai.sh /path/to/your/project/folder
     ```
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/your/project/folder
     ```
   - Make the script executable:
     ```sh
     chmod +x setup-python-ai.sh
     ```
   - Run the `setup-python-ai.sh` script:
     ```sh
     ./setup-python-ai.sh
     ```

### Windows

1. **Python AI Projects**
   - Navigate to the `Windows\python` directory:
     ```cmd
     cd Windows\python
     ```
   - Copy the `setup-python-ai.bat` file to your project folder:
     ```cmd
     copy setup-python-ai.bat C:\path\to\your\project\folder
     ```
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```cmd
     cd C:\path\to\your\project\folder
     ```
   - Run the `setup-python-ai.bat` script:
     ```cmd
